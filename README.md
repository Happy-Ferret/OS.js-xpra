## Installation

```
./bin/add-package.sh xpra Xpra https://github.com/os-js/OS.js-xpra.git
```

## Usage

You'll need:

* Xpra installed (2.x or later)
* Websockify (**with the python module**)
* python-dbus, python-gobject

At the moment you'll have to manually start a process, for example Firefox:

```
xpra --no-daemon --bind-tcp=127.0.0.1:10000 --start=firefox --html=on start :2
```

Sound support has been added, but might not work for all codecs. Please report to me if you have any issues or strange errors.

## Working

* Window creation and events
* Overlays (like menus, tooltips and general popupus)
* Cursors and Icons
* Mouse input
* Keyboard input
* Audio streaming

## TODO

* SSL
* Overlay keyboard events
* Launcher via Service
* Clipboard

* Language Change
* Macro handling from original source
